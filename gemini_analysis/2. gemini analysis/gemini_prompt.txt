You are analyzing video frames and transcripts to extract a REUSABLE TEMPLATE SPECIFICATION. Your goal is to identify the visual DNA that makes this template recognizable and effective for its target niche.

CRITICAL FOCUS: Extract PARAMETRIC patterns - what elements are consistent (the template), and what elements vary (the parameters). Think like a template designer who needs to create a reusable system.

ANALYZE THESE KEYFRAMES AND TRANSCRIPTS TO EXTRACT:

1. TEMPLATE STRUCTURE (Observable Patterns):
   - Content flow: Intro → Hook → Body → CTA → Outro (describe each section's characteristics)
   - Hook strategy: What technique grabs attention in first 3 seconds? (visual surprise, question, bold statement, etc.)
   - Section transitions: How does content move between parts? (cuts, fades, visual motifs)
   - Text display patterns: How long does text stay on screen? Word count per frame? Reading pace?
   - Pacing rhythm: Fast cuts, slow burns, or variable? Pattern of speed changes?

2. VISUAL SYSTEM (Design Rules):
   - Layout grid: Where do elements sit? (rule of thirds, centered, asymmetric, golden ratio)
   - Safe zones: Margins where content never appears (top/bottom/sides percentages)
   - Layer hierarchy: Background → Subject → Text → Overlays (describe each layer's treatment)
   - Color system:
     * Primary colors and their usage (backgrounds, emphasis, CTAs)
     * Color meaning/purpose in this template
     * Contrast patterns
   - Typography rules:
     * Font characteristics (sans/serif, weight, style - be specific about appearance)
     * Size hierarchy (when big vs small text is used)
     * Alignment patterns (centered vs left-aligned for different content types)
     * Text animation style (how it enters: fade/slide/typewriter/immediate)

3. MOTION LANGUAGE (Animation Patterns):
   - Camera behavior: Static locked vs moving (pans, zooms, follows)
   - Subject movement: How subjects enter/exit frame, movement speed
   - Text motion: Entry animation style, exit style, timing
   - Transition vocabulary: What transitions are used and when? (cut, dissolve, wipe, zoom)
   - Animation easing: Snappy/instant vs smooth/flowing
   - Which elements animate and which stay static?

4. CONTENT FORMULA (What Makes This Work):
   - Primary format: Talking head, screencast, text overlays, b-roll montage, mixed
   - Content mix ratio: If mixed, approximate percentage of each type
   - B-roll usage pattern: When does it appear? How long? What purpose? (illustration, transition, emphasis)
   - Text-to-visual ratio: Heavy text overlays vs minimal text
   - Storytelling structure: Narrative, problem-solution, list/steps, comparison, transformation
   - Information density: How much information per frame/second?

5. NICHE-SPECIFIC DESIGN CHOICES (Why This Template Works Here):
   - What NICHE does this target? (Be specific: not just "tech" but "SaaS productivity tools" or "AI consumer apps")
   - Secondary/adjacent niches this could work for
   - Niche conventions followed: What design patterns are standard in this industry?
   - Audience psychology: What viewer expectations does this fulfill?
   - Trust signals: What builds credibility for this specific audience? (certifications, data, testimonials, professionalism, authenticity)
   - Niche-specific visual language: Colors, fonts, pace that signal "this is for [audience]"
   - Why THIS template for THIS niche?: What makes this design effective here vs other verticals?

6. PARAMETRIC VARIABLES (What Can Be Customized):
   - Fixed elements: What MUST stay the same to maintain template identity?
   - Variable elements: What CAN change while keeping the template recognizable?
   - Content slots: Where does unique content go? (text zones, image areas, b-roll sections)
   - Customization boundaries: How much can you vary before it's not the same template?
   - Brand adaptation: What elements can be swapped for different brands?

7. DISTINCTIVE SIGNATURE (What Makes This Unique):
   - Visual fingerprint: If you saw this template again, what would you recognize?
   - Recurring motifs: Shapes, animations, transitions that repeat
   - Style differentiators: How is this different from generic templates?
   - Innovation elements: Anything unusual or creative?
   - Template "personality": Professional, playful, urgent, calm, bold, minimal?

8. TECHNICAL EXECUTION (How It's Made):
   - Lighting approach: High-key (bright, low shadows), low-key (dramatic shadows), natural, flat
   - Color grading style: Warm/cool tones, saturated/desaturated, high/low contrast
   - Depth of field: Shallow (blurry background) vs deep focus
   - Camera quality indicators: Professional vs smartphone aesthetics
   - Graphics style: Flat design, gradients, 3D, hand-drawn, photo-realistic
   - Stock vs custom: Which elements appear to be stock resources vs custom-created?

9. REPLICATION BLUEPRINT (How to Recreate):
   - Software category needed: Basic video editor, motion graphics tool, animation software, screen recorder
   - Key capabilities required: What features must the software have?
   - Asset list: Specific assets needed (background types, font styles, graphic elements, music mood)
   - Production workflow: Major steps to create this template
   - Complexity assessment: Simple (mostly cuts and text), Moderate (some motion graphics), Complex (heavy animation), Very Complex (3D/advanced effects)
   - Template automation potential: Could this be built as a reusable template in video software?

10. PATTERN ANALYSIS (Cross-Video Intelligence):
   - Similar templates you can identify: Does this match known template styles?
   - Template category: Tutorial, Product Demo, Testimonial, Explainer, Announcement, Story, Listicle, Review, etc.
   - Versatility: Can this template work for different content types or is it specialized?
   - Scalability: Can this work for 15 seconds or 5 minutes, or is it duration-specific?

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- Focus on OBSERVABLE patterns from the frames and transcript
- Prioritize PARAMETRIC information - what defines the template vs what varies
- Be SPECIFIC about niche targeting and why this design fits that niche
- Avoid guessing at production metrics (time, cost, etc.)
- Return ONLY the JSON object, no markdown formatting
- All descriptions should enable someone to recreate the template
- Emphasize the CONNECTION between template choices and niche effectiveness
