A centered chest-up shot of a founder in a real-world room environment, natural window or ambient lighting from the side creating soft, even illumination across the subject's face and torso. Medium depth of field keeps the background slightly soft but recognizable—desk, shelf, or wall details remain visible but not sharp. Subject positioned dead-center frame, neutral expression with slight energy, eyes mostly toward camera with minor natural deviations. Room background features muted, desaturated tones—grays, beiges, or soft whites—with minimal clutter. Lighting is flat to moderate contrast, avoiding dramatic shadows or highlights. No color grading, no cinematic effects. Composition is clean, utilitarian, and authentic, resembling a typical smartphone or webcam self-recording setup. Subject wears casual startup attire. Frame is static, stable, and frontal with no angle or tilt. Overall mood is approachable, genuine, and unpolished—like a real founder recording an update at their desk.
