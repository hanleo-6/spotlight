This is day 13 of building my startup in public and this is how many people signed up to use my app after 24 hours of launching. For those of you that don't know, I'm currently building solely an audio journaling platform that allows you to journal three things, something beautiful, something annoying, and something that you're thankful for. I just launched on Friday the 21st and at the end of the day, I had a total of 50 signed up users and I had one paying premium user. And by the end of day two, I had over 80 signed up users and two paying premium users. The premium version of solely backs up your audio recordings into the cloud so you never have to worry about losing them. Whereas the non-premium version just stores on your device so if you get a new phone or uninstall the app, you kind of lose all your journal recordings. Go to the link in my bio to download the app and let me know how it is. Next up is learning how to scale and grow this app. Make sure to follow me if you wanna keep up with my startup journey.
