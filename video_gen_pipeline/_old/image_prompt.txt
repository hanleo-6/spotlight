A person seated center frame against a simple, muted background, directly facing a smartphone camera mounted on a static tripod. Natural ambient lighting creates even illumination with normal depth of field and neutral color temperature. The subject maintains relaxed posture with hands visible, making mostly direct but occasionally imperfect eye contact with the lens. Medium shot framing shows head, shoulders, and upper torso. Clean, uncluttered background with high contrast separation from subject. The scene has authentic, unpolished quality—no dramatic lighting, no shallow depth of field, no color grading. Composition follows rule of thirds with subject centered. Space above head allows for text overlay placement. Lighting is soft and diffused from natural window light or basic room lighting. The overall aesthetic is straightforward, educational content creator style—genuine and approachable rather than cinematic or overly produced.
