A smartphone on tripod captures a centered tech educator against a simple, high-contrast background with natural lighting. The camera remains static throughout. The video opens with the speaker gesturing emphatically while stating "Everyone is always talking about how easy it is to hack no-code apps." They maintain moderate eye contact with subtle posture shifts. At 0:05, bold sans-serif text fades in center-screen reading "3 No-Code Security Mistakes" then fades out. The speaker continues explaining, making occasional hand gestures. At 0:15, a cut transitions to the same setup as text overlay fades in: "MISTAKE #1: Missing Backend Checks." The speaker demonstrates by miming clicking a disabled button, then makes a direct API call gesture. Text fades displaying "Non-admins can delete projects" before fading out. At 0:30, another cut introduces "MISTAKE #2: Exposing User Data" in faded text. The speaker points at an invisible screen, tracing their finger down a list while explaining leaderboard endpoints. Text appears showing "Emails, IDs, Metadata = Exposed" then fades. At 0:45, a final cut brings up "MISTAKE #3: Public Upload Endpoints." The speaker opens an imaginary DevTools panel with hand motions, revealing concern through subtle facial shifts. Text displays "S3/Firebase = Public Access" before fading. At 1:00, the speaker delivers closing advice with a calm, direct gaze. The video ends with a simple logo and tagline fading onto a clean background.
